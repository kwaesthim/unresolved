# Unresolved

This repository contains a broken and incomplete attempt at simulating multi-qubit systems using a recursive Hadamard construction. The logic failed. The clarity escaped. The purpose? Uncertain.

## Abstract

This was supposed to go somewhere. It didn't. Ideas tangled into noise.

## Clue

Run the code, watch the failure. There's no tensor. No coherence. Just entropy.
